                <p>
                    I decided what content to use based off previous experience of similar website. Because we weren't given much time to create the initial site plan I didn't get the best images.<br><br>
                    I mainly used gmail and in-class time to communicate with the Lead Developer. We didn't have any issues in communication. The only problem that occured was I wasn't sent the site URL till recently.<br><br>
                    Yes. The Lead Developer more or less met my expectation for the site.<br><br>
                    I will probably spend more time designing the website and picking out images.

                <p>
                    I used gmail, discord, and in-class time to communicate with my junior developers. All of them recieved the information they needed to complete their work.<br><br>
                    I communicated with my client mainly in-class and with gmail. I recieved all the information I needed and asked for feedback.<br><br>
                    I published the site using GitHub Pages. I didn't run into any issues.<br><br>
                    So far I have had a good experience with GitHub. I will definitely be using it more often.

                <h3>Junior Report</h3>
                <p>
                    I had tried to contact my Lead Developers through gmail because they often weren't in class. I had many issues. I was only invited to the GitHubs recently as our client report was due. I still haven't recieved the Site Plan for one.<br><br>
                    I still don't know whats expected of me for one. The other one I created my own CSS and HTML from scratch to complete the page because the Lead Developer hadn't done any work for the site.<br><br>
                    I contributed to one. However the other I haven't been given the site plan for or recieved any other communication to complete any work.<br><br>
                    GitHub has worked well for me. I haven't encountered any issues.

                <h3>Client Report</h3>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part was trying to communicate with my Lead Developers. I did not manage to overcome it.<br><br>
                    I most enjoyed coding the HTML and CSS itself. I had a lot of fun creating my Hewitt page even though it was beyond the scope of a Junior Developer.<br><br>
                    I would spend my time designing my site and choosing correct images. I would also see if maybe I could have communicated better with my Lead Developers. Although I don't know what I could have done.<br><br>
                    Absolutely. I still have a lot to learn (especially when it comes to design) but I am confident I could make a good website utilizing the basics of HTML and CSS.
